"""
Linear Algebra Package for Scientific Computing

A comprehensive linear algebra library providing core operations, decompositions,
and linear system solvers with Berkeley-themed examples and visualizations.

Modules:
    core.matrix_operations: Matrix arithmetic, decompositions, and properties
    core.vector_operations: Vector operations, norms, and algorithms  
    core.linear_systems: Direct and iterative linear system solvers
    
Examples:
    examples.beginner.basic_operations: Fundamental operations and concepts
    examples.intermediate.matrix_decompositions: Advanced decomposition techniques
    examples.advanced.iterative_methods: Large system solvers and preconditioning
